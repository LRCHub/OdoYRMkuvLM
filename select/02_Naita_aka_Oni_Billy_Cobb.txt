I've been so lonely
Nobody's my friend
I've missed you dearly
Since our friendship's end

And I promise I'm no good without you
And I gave you up for everything
My Naita Aka Oni you've left me by my hand

Standing and waiting
Therapeutic rain
Wait for your memory
To come save me away

And I promise I'm no good without you
And I gave you up for everything
My Naita Aka Oni you've left me by my hand
You've left me by my hand
By my hand
By my hand

And I promise I'm no good without you
And I gave you up for everything
My Naita Aka Oni you've left me by my hand
