Sinful contract made did not state
You were my relative
Clumsy demon, household keeper
You don't make the cut of a little sister
Are you cooking or killing?

Conquer, conquer, run away
The screen shatters by raiment
Conquer, conquer, run away
Send me something from heaven

Reality is just a crappy game
The law of the PFP will keep me the same
Blood memories

Conquer, conquer, run away
The screen shatters by raiment
Conquer, conquer, run away
Send me something from heaven

Believe in Daisuke, Oni

Oni-chan??
Look my way, you're so mean
(Oni, oni)
Hentai, love my senpai
Itadakimasu

Pause my life without saving
Could I accept someone not 2-D? (Oh no!)
Forever my buddy and my whole
God only knows
Fire trucks can't stop us
Fire trucks can't stop

Pause my life without saving
Could I accept someone not 2-D? (Oh yeah!)
Forever my buddy and my whole
God only knows
Fire trucks can't stop us
Fire trucks can't stop

Believe in Daisuke, Oni

Tadaima, Onee-san
I can see the ending, sorry to keep you waiting
This Otamega knows how to save the day, yeah!

Omai-wa, Onee-san
We're keeping our necks by getting chicks
With me and your broom, we'll clean these fools
Life will be better not dead

Nip at your finger because
We can share the same blood
In your bathtime, I scrub your PFP
So you love your imouto
